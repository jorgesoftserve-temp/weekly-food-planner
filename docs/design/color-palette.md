## 1. Brand palette (verbatim source)

| Name | HEX | HSL | RGB | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Strawberry red** | `#fb4b66` | `hsl(351, 96%, 64%)` | `251, 75, 102` | **Brand.** Active brand moments, gradient stops, default accent. *(Was `#fb4b4e`/359° — rosied to 351° on 2026-06-08; see §4.3.)* |
| Moss green | `#5fad56` | `hsl(114, 35%, 51%)` | `95, 173, 86` | Success / positive / default app accent surface. |
| Jungle teal | `#4d9078` | `hsl(159, 30%, 43%)` | `77, 144, 120` | Secondary / calm info. |
| Tuscan sun | `#f2c14e` | `hsl(42, 86%, 63%)` | `242, 193, 78` | Warning / highlight / gradient warmth. |
| Pastel petal | `#ffcbdd` | `hsl(339, 100%, 90%)` | `255, 203, 221` | **Decoration only** — soft backgrounds, badge fills, gradient stops. Never text or a text-bearing fill. |

## 2. Semantic tokens

These map the brand palette onto shadcn's variable names. They are HSL channel triplets (no `hsl()`
wrapper) to match the shadcn convention in `globals.css`. Edit `:root` and `.dark` **together**.

### Light (`:root`)

| Token | HSL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--background` | `0 0% 100%` | White base. |
| `--foreground` | `0 0% 12%` | Warm near-black. |
| `--card` / `--popover` | `0 0% 100%` | |
| `--card-foreground` / `--popover-foreground` | `0 0% 12%` | |
| `--primary` | `359 79% 56%` | Strawberry **tuned down** so white text hits AA (see §4.2). |
| `--primary-foreground` | `0 0% 100%` | |
| `--secondary` | `159 30% 43%` | Jungle teal. |
| `--secondary-foreground` | `0 0% 100%` | |
| `--accent` | `114 35% 51%` | Moss green — default app accent surface (overridden per-user). |
| `--accent-foreground` | `0 0% 100%` | |
| `--muted` | `339 60% 97%` | Faint pastel-petal tint (warm, not gray). |
| `--muted-foreground` | `0 0% 42%` | |
| `--destructive` | `0 72% 41%` | **Deep crimson text** — for `text-destructive` on surfaces (allergen chips, error labels, badge text on tint). Distinct from brand red (see §4.1). |
| `--destructive-foreground` | `0 0% 100%` | |
| `--destructive-solid` | `0 72% 41%` | **Solid fill** for Button/Badge `variant="destructive"`. White on fill: **~6.7:1** ✓. Light value equals `--destructive` (same deep crimson). See §4.12. |
| `--destructive-tint` | `0 72% 95%` | Soft background for destructive-state badges. `--destructive` text on this tint: **~5.61:1** ✓. See §4.10. |
| `--border` / `--input` | `0 0% 90%` | |
| `--ring` | `359 79% 56%` | Focus ring = brand (overridden per-user accent). |
| `--radius` | `1rem` | Cozy Phase 3 bump (was `0.65rem`). Cascades to `lg/md/sm` border-radius tokens. |
| `--radius-pill` | `9999px` | Full pill — buttons, chips, badges, segmented controls. |
| `--shadow-sm` | `0 1px 2px hsl(20 30% 12% / 0.04), 0 1px 3px hsl(20 30% 12% / 0.06)` | Inputs, ghost surfaces. |
| `--shadow-md` | `0 2px 6px hsl(20 30% 12% / 0.05), 0 6px 16px hsl(20 30% 12% / 0.08)` | Cards default. |
| `--shadow-lg` | `0 8px 24px hsl(20 30% 12% / 0.10), 0 16px 40px hsl(20 30% 12% / 0.10)` | Modals, popovers, card hover. |
| `--success` | `114 40% 32%` | Moss — Accepted / done states. |
| `--success-tint` | `114 40% 94%` | Soft background for success badges. |
| `--warning` | `34 70% 24%` | Tuscan — Draft / Modified / "Expiring soon" / "Missing items" badges. Darkened from `30%` to `24%` on 2026-06-10 so small badge text clears **4.5:1** on `--warning-tint` (measured: ~6.1:1). See §4.6. |
| `--warning-tint` | `42 90% 90%` | Soft background for warning badges. |
| `--purchase` | `205 75% 36%` | Ocean-blue — purchase-source badges, on-hand inventory annotations. **Domain-semantic; do not reuse `--user-accent-*`.** Clears 4.5:1 on white (5.33:1) and on `--purchase-tint` (4.73:1). See §4.7. |
| `--purchase-tint` | `205 80% 95%` | Soft background for purchase-source badges. |
| `--tag-neutral` | `0 0% 30%` | Text color for neutral/gray tags (Pantry, unclassified). ~7.03:1 on `--tag-neutral-tint`. See §4.8. |
| `--tag-neutral-tint` | `0 0% 91%` | Fill for neutral tags. Paired with `--tag-neutral-border` for card delineation. |
| `--tag-neutral-border` | `0 0% 55%` | Border for neutral tags. ~3.33:1 against white card — passes WCAG 1.4.11. See §4.8. |
| `--card-padding` | `1.25rem` | Uniform card inner padding (CardHeader / CardContent / CardFooter). |

### Dark (`.dark`)

| Token | HSL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--background` | `20 6% 10%` | Warm near-black (not slate-blue). |
| `--foreground` | `0 0% 96%` | |
| `--card` / `--popover` | `20 6% 13%` | Raised surface. |
| `--card-foreground` / `--popover-foreground` | `0 0% 96%` | |
| `--primary` | `359 84% 64%` | Strawberry **lightened** for dark-surface contrast. |
| `--primary-foreground` | `0 0% 100%` | |
| `--secondary` | `159 28% 42%` | |
| `--secondary-foreground` | `0 0% 100%` | |
| `--accent` | `114 32% 48%` | |
| `--accent-foreground` | `0 0% 100%` | |
| `--muted` | `20 6% 16%` | |
| `--muted-foreground` | `0 0% 64%` | |
| `--destructive` | `0 65% 68%` | Lighter crimson, raised to 68% L so it reads as **light text** on dark tint surfaces. Clears 4.5:1 on `--destructive-tint` (dark: **~5.38:1** ✓). Still ≠ brand. See §4.10. |
| `--destructive-foreground` | `0 0% 100%` | |
| `--destructive-solid` | `0 65% 50%` | **Solid fill** for Button/Badge `variant="destructive"` in dark mode. White on fill: **~5.05:1** ✓. Darker than `--destructive` text (50% vs 68% L) so the solid button remains distinct. See §4.12. |
| `--destructive-tint` | `0 50% 18%` | Dark tinted surface for destructive-state badges. Paired with `--destructive` text. See §4.10. |
| `--border` / `--input` | `0 0% 20%` | |
| `--ring` | `359 84% 64%` | |
| `--shadow-sm` | `0 1px 2px hsl(0 0% 0% / 0.30)` | Dark depth — pure black, higher opacity. |
| `--shadow-md` | `0 4px 12px hsl(0 0% 0% / 0.35)` | |
| `--shadow-lg` | `0 12px 32px hsl(0 0% 0% / 0.45)` | |

| `--warning-tint` | `38 45% 20%` | Dark tinted surface. |
| `--purchase` | `205 80% 62%` | Lightened for dark-surface contrast. Clears 4.5:1 on dark card `hsl(20 6% 13%)` (~6.0:1). |
| `--purchase-tint` | `205 45% 20%` | Dark tinted surface for purchase badges. |
| `--tag-neutral` | `0 0% 64%` | Text color for neutral tags on dark surfaces. ~4.76:1 on `--tag-neutral-tint`. |
| `--tag-neutral-tint` | `0 0% 22%` | Fill for neutral tags on dark card surfaces. |
| `--tag-neutral-border` | `0 0% 44%` | Border for neutral tags. ~3.10:1 against dark card `hsl(20 6% 13%)` — passes WCAG 1.4.11. |

The `--sidebar-*` family inherits these (warm-dark sidebar in dark, near-white sidebar in light).

## 3. Gradient gallery — subtle tints only

Defined as CSS vars + Tailwind utilities. **Rule: ≤12% color opacity in light, ≤6% in dark.** A
gradient is a *whisper* of warmth over the surface, never a saturated wash.

| Utility | Light | Dark | Where it's allowed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bg-gradient-hero` | `linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(351 96% 64% / 0.08), hsl(42 86% 63% / 0.08))` | same hues @ `0.05` | Page-header band, dashboard welcome. One per screen, top only. |
| `bg-gradient-empty` | `linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(114 35% 51% / 0.08), hsl(159 30% 43% / 0.06))` | @ `0.05` | Empty-state cards. |
| `bg-gradient-selected` | `linear-gradient(90deg, hsl(339 100% 90% / 0.45), transparent)` | `hsl(359 84% 64% / 0.10)` | Active/selected row or chip. |
| `border-gradient-feature` | 2px top border `strawberry → pastel-petal` | strawberry → muted | Featured/“new” card edge only. |

**Never:** stack two gradients on one element, apply a gradient behind body text below AA, or use the
full 5-color rainbow gradient anywhere in product UI (it exists only as a brand asset).

## 4. Visual restrictions (the hard rules)

### 4.1 Brand red ≠ destructive red
The brand **is** red, so destructive actions must not also be bright red or users can't distinguish
"delete" from "primary".
- **Destructive = deep crimson.** Use `--destructive-solid` (`0 72% 41%` light / `0 65% 50%` dark)
  for **solid fills** (Button/Badge `variant="destructive"`). Use `--destructive` for **text on
  surfaces** (allergen chips, error labels, status badges on `--destructive-tint`). Both are always
  paired with an icon + an explicit verb ("Delete recipe", trash icon). See §4.12.
- **Bright strawberry is reserved** for primary / positive / neutral CTAs. Never style a destructive
  action strawberry, and never style a primary action crimson.

### 4.2 `#fb4b66` fails AA for white text
At `64%` lightness the literal strawberry gives ~3:1 against white — below the 4.5:1 body-text
threshold.
- `--primary` is therefore tuned to `359 79% 56%` (light) for any **fill that carries text**.
- The literal `#fb4b66` is allowed only for **large text (≥24px/≥18px bold), borders, icons, and
  gradient stops** — never small text on it, never small text of it on white.

### 4.3 Brand hue (351°) vs primary-fill hue (359°)
On 2026-06-08 the **brand strawberry was rosied** `#fb4b4e → #fb4b66` (359° → 351°). This moved the
**decorative brand literal** (hero gradient stop) and the **default `strawberry` per-user accent** to
351°. `--primary` / `--ring` / `--sidebar-primary` were **deliberately left at 359°** (the AA-tuned
fill) — the product decision was "change strawberry, keep primary." The ~8° gap is imperceptible at
these values; primary CTAs stay on 359°, brand washes/accents on 351°. `--secondary` (`159 30% 43%`)
unchanged.

### 4.4 Pastel-petal is decoration only
Background tints, badge fills, gradient stops — yes. Text, or any fill that carries text — no (it's
90% L, nothing readable sits on it).

### 4.5 Tokens only
No hex / `rgb()` / `hsl()` literals in component files. Every color resolves to a token here. Need a
color a token doesn't cover? Add the token; don't inline it.

### 4.6 `--warning` small-text contrast (2026-06-10)
Badge text ("Expiring soon", "Missing items") is small (12px / `text-xs`). At `34 70% 30%` on
`--warning-tint` (`42 90% 90%`) the contrast was ~3.1:1 — below AA for small text. The light value
was darkened to `34 70% 24%`; measured ratio is **~6.1:1** on the tint. Dark-mode value is unchanged
(`42 90% 70%`) — it resolves against a dark tinted surface and already clears AA.

### 4.7 `--purchase` domain-semantic token (2026-06-10)
A new **ocean-blue** token pair representing the "purchase" domain in inventory and grocery views.
- **Light** `205 75% 36%`: text on white = **5.33:1** ✓, text on `--purchase-tint` = **4.73:1** ✓.
- **Dark** `205 80% 62%`: text on dark card `hsl(20 6% 13%)` = **6.04:1** ✓.
- **Do not** reuse `--user-accent-*` for this; the purchase color is a domain semantic that must
  not shift when the user picks a different accent.
- Tailwind token: `bg-purchase-tint`, `text-purchase`, `border-purchase/{opacity}`.

### 4.8 `--tag-neutral` neutral-tag treatment (2026-06-10)
A gray token triple for tags that carry no semantic meaning (e.g. "Pantry", unclassified inventory).
The fill alone is too light to delineate a badge from the white card at WCAG 1.4.11, so a border is
required and is baked into the `.badge-neutral` utility class.

**Light:**
- `--tag-neutral` `0 0% 30%` — text. On fill: **~7.03:1** ✓ (AA small text).
- `--tag-neutral-tint` `0 0% 91%` — fill. Against white card alone: ~1.20:1 (intentionally relies on border).
- `--tag-neutral-border` `0 0% 55%` — 1 px border. Against white card: **~3.33:1** ✓ (WCAG 1.4.11).

**Dark:**
- `--tag-neutral` `0 0% 64%` — text. On fill: **~4.76:1** ✓.
- `--tag-neutral-tint` `0 0% 22%` — fill.
- `--tag-neutral-border` `0 0% 44%` — border. Against dark card `hsl(20 6% 13%)`: **~3.10:1** ✓ (WCAG 1.4.11).

**Usage:** Apply the single `.badge-neutral` CSS class (defined in `globals.css`) to the badge root,
or compose with Tailwind: `bg-tag-neutral-tint border border-tag-neutral-border text-tag-neutral`.
Pair with Tailwind's `rounded-pill` and `text-xs font-medium` for the standard badge shape.

### 4.9 Info indicator — grocery on-hand annotation (2026-06-10)
The grocery view uses a small blue dot/icon to indicate on-hand inventory data (reveals a popover on
click). **Reuse `--purchase`** — it is already ocean-blue, AA-compliant, and semantically covers the
"inventory/pantry" domain. A separate `--info` token is not warranted.

- **Clickable dot / icon:** `text-purchase` (as a text-color icon) or a 6–8 px filled circle with
  `background-color: hsl(var(--purchase))`. Both clear 3:1 non-text contrast against white
  (light: **5.33:1**, dark: **6.04:1**) and 4.5:1 as text.
- **Popover accent stripe / header tint (optional):** `bg-purchase-tint` — the pale blue tint
  visually ties the popover back to the indicator without a heavy fill.
- Tailwind classes for the builder: dot/icon = `text-purchase` (or `bg-purchase` for a filled dot),
  popover accent = `bg-purchase-tint text-purchase`.
- **Do not** use `--user-accent-*` here; the color must be stable across accent preferences.

### 4.10 `--destructive-tint` + dark-mode destructive contrast remediation (2026-06-11)
The `--destructive` token was missing a corresponding tint surface. Components in the design-lab were
using `bg-destructive/10` (Tailwind opacity shorthand) which at 10% opacity over the dark card gives a
surface too close in luminance to the mid-tone dark destructive text — approximately 3.0:1.

**Fix:**
- Added `--destructive-tint` as a proper token pair (light + dark).
- Raised dark `--destructive` from `0 65% 50%` to `0 65% 68%` so it functions as **light text** on
  the dark tint surface (same principle as `--success`, `--warning`, `--purchase` in dark mode).

**Light:**
- `--destructive` `0 72% 41%` — unchanged. On `--destructive-tint`: **~5.61:1** ✓.
- `--destructive-tint` `0 72% 95%` — very light crimson wash, analogous to `--success-tint` light.

**Dark:**
- `--destructive` `0 65% 68%` — raised 18 L-points from `50%`. On dark card `hsl(20 6% 13%)`:
  text is now the lighter element, clears 4.5:1. On `--destructive-tint` (dark): **~5.38:1** ✓.
- `--destructive-tint` `0 50% 18%` — dark crimson surface. Analogous to dark success/warning tints.

**Usage in components:** `bg-destructive-tint text-destructive` (or Tailwind: `bg-destructive/tint`).
Do NOT use `bg-destructive/10` as an ad-hoc tint — use this token pair.
The `.dark` raised value keeps destructive still visually distinct from the brand (brand is 351° hue;
destructive is 0°/360°) and lighter than the light value's fill (68% vs 41%) — intentional.

### 4.11 Dark-mode accent chip contrast remediation (2026-06-11)
`text-accent-strong` on `bg-accent-tint` in dark mode was measuring below WCAG AA (~3.5:1) for
several accents because the `--user-accent-strong` L values (68–76%) left insufficient margin against
the very dark tint surfaces (L=18–22%). The principle in dark mode is the same as `--success` /
`--warning` / `--purchase`: the "strong" value is a **light text** color on a dark-but-tinted surface.

**Fix (2026-06-11):** Raised dark `--user-accent-strong` to 80–83% L across all six accents.
Dark `--user-accent-tint` surfaces were simultaneously nudged 2 L-points darker to deepen contrast.

| Accent | Old strong / tint | New strong / tint | Measured ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| strawberry | `351 85% 75%` / `351 40% 22%` | `351 85% 82%` / `351 40% 20%` | ~5.68:1 → **~8.1:1** ✓ |
| moss | `114 45% 68%` / `114 28% 20%` | `114 48% 80%` / `114 30% 18%` | ~3.5:1 → **~8.6:1** ✓ |
| teal | `159 42% 64%` / `159 28% 18%` | `159 44% 80%` / `159 30% 16%` | ~3.5:1 → **~8.3:1** ✓ |
| amber | `42 90% 70%` / `38 45% 20%` | `42 90% 80%` / `38 45% 18%` | ~7.3:1 → **~9.3:1** ✓ |
| ocean | `205 80% 72%` / `205 45% 20%` | `205 80% 82%` / `205 45% 18%` | ~6.4:1 → **~9.5:1** ✓ |
| plum | `288 55% 76%` / `288 35% 22%` | `288 55% 83%` / `288 35% 20%` | ~6.2:1 → **~9.1:1** ✓ |

Light-mode `--user-accent-strong` values are unchanged (they already passed AA).

### 4.12 `--destructive-solid` — dedicated solid-fill token for destructive primitives (2026-06-11)
`--destructive` is dual-use: it serves as **text on a tinted surface** (allergen chips, error labels,
`bg-destructive-tint` badges — ~8 usage sites) AND as a **solid background fill** (Button/Badge
`variant="destructive"` — 2 primitives). These two roles have mutually exclusive lightness needs:

- Text on a dark tint surface needs **≥~65% L** (dark mode) to clear 4.5:1.
- Solid fill with white text needs **≤~50% L** to keep white-on-fill ≥ 4.5:1.

`--destructive` was raised to `0 65% 68%` (dark) by §4.10 to fix the text-on-tint usage. This broke
white-on-solid on the two primitives (measured: ~2.90:1 — failed AA and 3:1). Fix: a separate
`--destructive-solid` token governs only those two solid-fill usages.

| Token | Light | Dark | White-on ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--destructive-solid` | `0 72% 41%` | `0 65% 50%` | light **~6.7:1** ✓ / dark **~5.05:1** ✓ |

**Primitives updated:** `Button variant="destructive"` → `bg-destructive-solid hover:bg-destructive-solid/90`; `Badge variant="destructive"` → `bg-destructive-solid hover:bg-destructive-solid/80`. `text-destructive-foreground` unchanged on both.

**`text-destructive` is NOT changed** — it continues to point at `--destructive` (text role, 8+ sites).

**Light note:** In light mode both tokens share the same value (`0 72% 41%`). The split is
architecturally correct but only materially visible in dark mode.

## 5. Do / Don't

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| Primary button = `bg-primary text-primary-foreground` | Hardcode `bg-[#fb4b66]` in a component |
| Delete button = `variant="destructive"` + trash icon + "Delete" | Make delete a bright-red primary-looking button |
| One subtle `bg-gradient-hero` band at the top of a page | Full-page saturated gradient background |
| Pastel-petal as a badge background with dark text | Pastel-petal text on white |
| Raise lightness for dark-mode accents | Reuse the exact light HSL in `.dark` |
